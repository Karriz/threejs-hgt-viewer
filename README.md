Viewing NASA SRTM .hgt heightmaps in three.js
You can get 3'' resolution elevation data for the entire world from there: http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/dem3.html
You need to have the hgt files in the Heightmaps- folder, and then select the zoom level and coordinates in app.js. The application will load a satellite image from Google, and use it as a texture for the heightmap.
